I started building this game after I was browsing
[eloquentjavascript.net](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) and seeing the image of the game it
shows you how to make. I decided I didn't want to follow the instructions and that I wanted to
write it on my own.

## goal

My goal is to write a game framework that will work with any level created in HTML that follows
a few rules. I am writing it in TypeScript, compiling to ES6, and babel'ing
(transcompiling) to ES2015.
